In this work we address the Algorithm Selection Problem, i.e., the decision of which algorithm to use from a set of alternatives, given an instance. For the selection, we take into account a given time limit as a parameter. Hence, the learning is based on the anytime behavior of the algorithms. We test this approach over the well known **Knapsack Problem**.
